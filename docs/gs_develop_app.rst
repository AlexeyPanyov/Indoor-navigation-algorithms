Develop Indoor Navigation App
=============================

Once the `infrastructure is deployed <gs_setup_infrastructure.html.html>`__, `maps (locations) are implemented <gs_create_maps.html>`__, and both `linked to each other <gs_link_infrastructure.html>`__, you can start developing the indoor navigation app. 

SDK for Android
---------------

For Android app development, use the Navigine's SDK available in the `Navigine's GitHub <https://github.com/AlexeyPanyov/Indoor-navigation-algorithms>`__.

Also consider using the Navigine's Demo app for testing and example purposes. Android demo app source code is available at the `Navigine's GitHub sub-folder <https://github.com/AlexeyPanyov/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/tree/master/demo%20apps/Android>`__.

For reference materials as well as Andoid SDK API descriptions, refer to `Using Navigine SDK for Android <da_using_android_sdk.html>`__.

SDK for iOS
-----------

For iOS app development, use the Navigine's SDK available in the `Navigine's GitHub <https://github.com/AlexeyPanyov/Indoor-navigation-algorithms>`__.

Also consider using the Navigine's Demo app for testing and example purposes. iOS demo app source code is available at the `Navigine's GitHub sub-folder <https://github.com/AlexeyPanyov/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/tree/master/demo%20apps/ios>`__.
