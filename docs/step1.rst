 

Step 1. Acquire the Infrastructure Components
=============================================

To get started with Navigine Indoor Location Services, you need to
acquire infrastructure components first. The following table provides
brief information about the components that you need to set up your
location's infrastructure.

+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. rubric:: Component      | .. rubric:: Description                                                                   |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Navigine Account           | | `Register <http://client.navigine.com/register>`__ a Navigine Account to get access to  |
|                            | | Navigine Indoor Location Services.                                                      |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Access to the Location     | | You will need physical access to the location once you are ready to deploy the          | 
|                            | | infrastructure components to their places.                                              |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Location's Dimensions      | | The building parameters are required at the stage of measuring sub-locations.           |
|                            | | The more precise this data is, the better is the navigation accuracy you get.           |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| BLE Beacons                | | You need iBeacon-compatible BLE beacons to set up your target location's infrastructure.|
|                            | | 8-15 beacons should be enough for a location of 1000 square meters.                     |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Wi-Fi Routers (optional)   | | As an alternative to using BLE beacons for indoor navigation, you can use a set of Wi-Fi|
|                            | | routers, which rather brings less accuracy and supports Android devices only.           |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Android Device             | | Which might be an Android smartphone or tablet with Bluetooth 4.0 onboard. Make sure    |
|                            | | that the device supports Bluetooth LE 4.0 and iBeacon protocol.                         |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Linux/Windows Machine      | | You also need a Linux or Windows OS machine for integrating the Navigine SDK into your  |
|                            | | navigations app for Android devices.                                                    |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mac                        | | To integrate the Navigine SDK into iOS apps, you definetely need a Mac OS machine and   |
|                            | | the corresponding developer's acount.                                                   |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once you have all the components that are required for your specific
infrastructure setup, go to `Step 2. Deploy the
Infrastructure <step2.htm>`__, where you find information on setting up
the target location.
