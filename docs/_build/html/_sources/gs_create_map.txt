Create the Map
==============

Once you infrastructure is ready for the indoor navigation implementation, you need to create a map of the target location.

At this step you need to:

1. Add master location in the `Navigine CMS's Locations tab <http://client.navigine.com/maps>`__. This is the place where you keep your location's maps, add obstacles, create routes, and so on.
2. Add sub-locations. Sub-locations are actual buildins/facilities/floors/. At this step you can import your engineering blueprints into the Navigine's CMS. Consider using the target location's engineering blueprints.
