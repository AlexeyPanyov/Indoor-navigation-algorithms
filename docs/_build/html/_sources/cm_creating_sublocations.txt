Creating Sub-locations
======================

Add sub-locations into the location(s) you've created earlier. Refer to `Creating Sub-locations <cm_creating_sublocations.html>`__ if
you need to create more locations.

The following table provides steps for creating sub-locations using the
Navigine Content Management System (CMS).

#. In the **Locations** tab, click the location's name in the list of locations, then click **Add Sub-locations**.

* **Title** - sub-location's name of your choice
* **Latitude and Longitude** (optional) - corresponding to bottom left corner of the picture you added, OR 
* if the latitude and longitude values are unknown, check the I don't know the latitude and longitude check box
* **Azimuth angle** - the angle between the North and the direction corresponding to the vertical axis of the picture you've attached. The angle is measured in degrees clockwise from the North direction. If the value is unknown, specify 0. You can edit the value later with the Edit sub-location button.

* **Add picture** button - enables you to add the sub-location's image for further reference. Consider using the location's (building's) original blueprints to simplify the subsequent map creation process. Only PNG and SVG image formats are supported.

Once you're done with adding sub-locations into your location(s), go to
`Measuring Sub-location Size <cm_measuring_sublocation.html>`__.
