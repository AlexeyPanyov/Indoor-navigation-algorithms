Creating Locations
==================

Prior to measuring the map or filling it with objects, you need to set
up the location in the Navigine CMS. See the following table for
description of the steps on your way to creating a location.


#. `Log into <http://client.navigine.com/login>`__ your Navigine user account.

#. In the **ADD LOCATION** dialog specify the name of the location and its description. Consider this location to be the whole building (master location), where you have sub-locations - floors and separate parts of the building.

#. Click **ADD** once you've filled in the information, or click **Cancel** if you need to go back.

Once you are done with creating locations, go to `Creating
Sub-locations <cm_creating_sublocations.html>`__.
